3: Molten Iron(5950K)   (bulk_viscosity: 3.3e-2 (Actually 3.2e-3, but too low values are bad) viscosity: 3.3e-2 rho: 12.51e3 gamma: ?; "Viscosity measurements on metal melts at highpressure and viscosity calculations for the earth's core")
Solid:
None (Fixed corrotated cannot handle high youngs modulus. So actually rubber is the only thing it can simulate without exploding.)
